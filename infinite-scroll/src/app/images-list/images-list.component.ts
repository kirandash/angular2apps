/* BehaviorSubject is a type of subject, a subject is a special type of observable so you can subscribe to messages like any other observable but it also has some unique features like:

A BehaviorSubject needs an initial value as it must always return a value on subscription even if it hasn't received a next()
A BehaviorSubject Upon subscription returns the last value of the subject. But A regular observable only triggers when it receives an onnext.
